9/17: Moved my Tools.* files to the team directory, implemented readRegister and
      writeRegister in registerFile together with Cori. Implemented ConditionCodes. 

9/20: Implemented and debugged/tested all methods in Memory.C file.

9/23: Debugged ConditionCodes file according to test results until all tests passed.

9/24: Begin lab 6, Loader.  

9/25-10/6: Incrementally worked on lab 6 with Cori. We met at various times and took turns 
            typing, so it was split in half. 

10/7: We finally figured out the problem in our loadLine function, implemented hasErrors.

I lost track of when we worked on things for a while, I'm sorry. But we worked together
to develop the structure of the pipeline and implement nops and halts. I completed 
lab8. 

11/12: Working on lab9 (OPq)
